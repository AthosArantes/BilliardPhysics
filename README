# Billiard Physics
A library for calculating billiard physics. This project takes the physics code from FooBillard++ into a single base class for further use.

**Changes**

 - Main physics code condensed into a single class, using modern C++;
 - Renamed classes/struct for better clarification;
 - ShapeGroup's for better collision detection performance;
 - Pocket edge collisions (Prevents ball from clipping through the table when falling into the pocket at very slow speeds);
 - The table "slate" or "cloth" is the plane zero, rather than using a shape;

**Requirements**
C++ 17 Compiler and the std library.
This projects provides a clean base for calculating billiard physics, but the interpretation of moved balls, collisions (ball-cushion, ball-ball) is still up to the developer to implement.
